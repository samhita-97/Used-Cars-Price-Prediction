# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction

Description:

Generally, the price of new car is fixed by the manufacturer, so the customer is assured of the quality. 
It is not the case for used cars where customers get easily deceived by fake companies and pay more for less worthy cars. 
Our idea is to implement different machine learning algorithms which predicts the price based on the features such as condition of the vehicle, 
entry year, manufacturer, model, etc. It helps customers to have knowledge on buying and selling price in the market.
